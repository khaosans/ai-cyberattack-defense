# Dashboard Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots of the AI Cyberattack Defense Dashboard for use in documentation and the main README.

## Required Images

The following images are currently in this directory and referenced in the main README:

1. **main-dashboard.png** - Main dashboard interface showing simulation controls, AI analysis settings (Ollama integration), threat level gauge, threat score timeline, and pattern distribution visualizations
2. **threat-detection-overview.png** - Comprehensive threat analysis dashboard showing threat timeline, current threat level gauge (semi-circular with color-coded zones), threat score timeline graph with threshold lines, and status indicators
3. **pattern-distribution.png** - Attack pattern distribution bar chart displaying four pattern types (normal, behavioral_anomaly, superhuman_speed, systematic_enumeration) with recent alerts and detections table
4. **security-assistant.png** - AI-powered security assistant chat interface ("Ask Security Assistant") providing detailed explanations of threat intelligence charts and visualizations

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Recommended Size**: 1200-1600px width for optimal display
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or 4:3 for dashboard screenshots
- **File Size**: Optimize for web (< 500KB per image)

## Usage

These images are referenced in the main README.md file with SEO-optimized alt text and descriptive captions.

## Adding New Screenshots

When adding new dashboard screenshots:

1. Capture screenshots at high resolution
2. Optimize images for web (reduce file size while maintaining quality)
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `threat-timeline-detailed.png`)
4. Update README.md with appropriate alt text and captions
5. Ensure images are accessible (good contrast, readable text)
